    <ul>
      <li><strong> Java Project-Number guessing Game </strong>: As iam learning from the very start as a beginner i created  a number guessing  game; where the computer randomly selects a number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the user has to guess the number. After each guess, the game should provide feedback, telling the player if the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. </li>
      <li><strong>Pyhton project</strong> : As python is my favourite language i have totally exposed to pyhton and tried variety of things and made plenty of projects.Among those project my favourite is the  rps-(rock,paper,scissors)game.I made it perfect then create a arcade where i put rps along with ather games where the user have options to select and play different games .</li>
