    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Java</strong>: I find Java fascinating because of its versatility and object-oriented principles, which I am learning to apply in building scalable applications. It’s widely used in the development of large-scale, enterprise-level software, and I am eager to master it for real-world projects</li>
      <li><strong>Python</strong>: Python stands out to me for its simplicity and readability. It’s one of my favorite languages and my first language to learn as a student because it allows me to focus more on solving problems and less on complex syntax. I use it for various projects, including data analysis, web development, and automation tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS and HTML</strong>:These essential front-end technologies help me bring creative ideas to life by designing interactive and user-friendly websites. I enjoy working with them as i love designing and building visually appealing web interfaces that enhance the user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>SQL</strong>: I’m also learning SQL to manage and query data in relational databases. It is a key skill for backend development, and I appreciate how it helps me structure and analyze data to support application functionality.</li>
