      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I'm, a second-year Computer Science student with a passion for software development. I'm currently diving deep into the world of coding, exploring everything from Java and Python to CSS, HTML, and SQL—each .
        As someone who's always curious about how things work, I love problem-solving and building projects that push my skills to the next level. Whether I'm designing sleek websites or creating smart, efficient algorithms, coding is my way of bringing ideas to life. 
        Beyond just the code, I'm all about collaborating with like-minded individuals, continuously learning new technologies, and contributing to the tech community. Every project I work on adds a new tool to my belt, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.
        I’m studying at University of Hertfordshire in pursuit of my Bachelor’s in Computer Science, and I’m absolutely loving the adventure. 
      <p>
        I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded people, continuously learning new technologies, and contributing to the tech community.
